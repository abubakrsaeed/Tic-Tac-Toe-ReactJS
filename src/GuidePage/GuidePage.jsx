                        Tic-Tac -Toe (along with a lot of other games) involves looking ahead and trying to figure out what the person playing against you might do next.

                    <h5>RULES FOR TIC-TAC-TOE</h5>
                    <ul className="lead">
                        <li>The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.</li>
                        <li>You are X, your friend O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.</li>
                        <li>The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.</li>
                        <li>When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.</li>

                    <h5>HOW CAN I WIN AT TIC-TAC-TOE?</h5>
                    <p className="lead">
                        To beat the other player (or at least tie), you need to make use of a little bit of strategy. Strategy means figuring out what you need to do to win.

                        Part of your strategy is trying to figure out how to get three Xs in a row. The other part is trying to figure out how to stop the other player from getting three Os in a row.

                        After you put an X in a square, you start looking ahead. Where's the best place for your next X? You look at the empty squares and decide which ones are good choicesâ€”which ones might let you make three Xs in a row.

                        You also have to watch where the other player puts its O. That could change what you do next. If the other player gets two Os in a row, you have to put your next X in the last empty square in that row, or the other player will win. You are forced to play in a particular square or lose the game.
